1. I've appreciated the most that people see me as someone to go to for help and that they see me as having been a valuable member of the team.

2. I think I feel resistant to feedback that I'm not listening well. It's partially because I take pride in my own listening skills but also because I feel that that particular feedback can engender more conflict over nothing. I think it's certainly been accurate at times that people have said it to me, but to put the communication failure on the listener only is never accurate 

8. It doesn't surprise me to hear that I'm working hard when it has been true. I think it's something that I can absolutely differentiate and if I've put in the work, I've got the experiences and scars to prove it; As Nas said "It ain't hard to tell".

9. Conversely, it is surprising to hear that I'm not working hard when I don't believe that's true. Like I said before, I think it's something that I can absolutely differentiate and it's always surprising to hear from others that I'm not working hard, if I think I am. Sometimes this can just be caused by time crunch in the project, and so if we're behind and i receive this feedback, I generally just try to keep upping my game and trying to do my best.
