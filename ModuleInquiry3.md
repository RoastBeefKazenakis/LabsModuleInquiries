1.  What feature did you work on with a teammate up to this point in the sprint?

Worked on getting the initial segues when opening the app to vary depending on the role of the user.

2.  When were you the driver? When were you the navigator? Which role did you prefer and why?

I was the driver. I generally prefer that currently because i think being hands-on helps me learn a little more efficiently, but I can enjoy being the navigator too.

3.  What was difficult about being a navigator?

Finding the correct words sometimes, where you might not bring something up which could result in lost time when you might have directed attention towards that thing if you had the right words.

4.  How will you adjust your pair programming behavior in the future?

Be active and mindful of everyone getting their viewpoint in without feeling interrupted, which I find can be an issue with Zoom pair programming.
