### 1. (For full-time only) What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?  
Are there any stretch goals which you would be interested in, but afraid to ask? 
### 2. What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.
- As an Administrator, I can edit Hub Profiles
- As an Administrator, I can view all Hubs in the database
- As an Administrator, I can create a profile.
### 3. Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?  
- As an Administrator, I can create a profile.

We need to implement Okta authentication as well as leveraging our backend to be able to tell if a user has "Administrator" privileges 
### 4. What did you do well in this task breakdown process? What were some challenges?  
Successfully identified/reasoned about some backend issues, came up with an elegant solution to potentially improve the flow of requesting administrator privileges.

It's been challenging understanding Okta and tracing functions in our existing code to the Okta package.

### 5. After what you've learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently? What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?

I would try to understand first of all where a potential hang-up would occur so we could approach those problems first, and I would try to break down tasks on that basis (which problems need to be solved in order to proceed on to other problems.
