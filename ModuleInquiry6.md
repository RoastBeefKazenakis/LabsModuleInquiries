1.  I've been afraid to give feedback to leaders and authority figures, one example is giving feedback to family members about things they do that bother me. As a sensitive person who can be really affected by these things, it's incredibly important for me to make them known, and the fact that I struggle with it shows the extreme nature of the fear.

2. I found myself commonly telling team members that it was great working with them. I think this was common because it was true! It really was great working with the team. While it was true, perhaps other feedback may have been more constructive, although I think it's important to develop this baseline positive rapport with the team.  I think while this kind of feedback is nice to hear, it is perhaps partially non-constructive in that it doesn't really single out which specific areas of working with the person are positive. 

3. I found myself telling my teammates to calm down often. In the context of a quick moving and big project, it's fairly obvious why this comes up a lot, but our team also had a lot of personal issues throughout, so relaxation was actually really key to making sure we got what we needed to done and didn't bite each-other's heads off. The irony is that we were a relatively calm team, the calmest I've had at lambda actually, so the commonality of this feedback is somewhat strange.

4. Honestly, none that come to mind

5. I think I could have given clearer feedback had I kept going back and forth about certain issues that I instead chose to drop for the sake of just moving forward quickly. In the future, I think it's important for me to be as vocal and as confident as I can be. I've learned an important lesson here, which is that being willing to fail in front of your team is an extreme asset to any team member, as we all have successes and failures by the end of our journey as a team. Since I'm willing to fail, I should also be willing to do the other difficult things such as clarifying feedback and being vocal about it (and I am!). Of course there's a balance in that it is both incorrect to give someone unconstructive feedback, as much as confidence might take us there before we have anything constructive to say. These are skills that are learned on every new team and in every new relationship, so I think having a process to understand this feedback layer of teams and relationships is the best way to keep improving.
