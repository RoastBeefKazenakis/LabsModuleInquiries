 1.  Stephanie Ballard-- That she has a lot more skill than she realizes and should be more confident in our peer programming sessions.
2.  a> It's generally easy to hear feedback about my listening skills as it's something I pride myself in being pretty flexible over, I really appreciate my own ability to listen and hate to crowd other people out, so the times that I got feedback that "I wasn't listening" were easy to hear and valuable
	b> It's more difficult to hear feedback about my coding in general, especially when peer programming. While the project was a team sport, it can be very difficult to deal with the different learning and coding styles of the team, so when people were frustrated with me during pair programming over how much time something was taking, or the difficulty i was having in fully understanding a concept, was also frustrating for me, as I like to keep emotion out of these sorts of things and learn very differently in different situations. Also, I try not to give feedback to others while I'm frustrated, so it can often feel like I'm singled out if others don't have that mindset.
	c> I think ultimately it was all relatively easy to process, as I was very happy with the team I was working with and really just care about what they had to say. If there had been less team cohesion, I think all the feedback would have been more difficult to process.

3. I would have to say that feedback I received about my acting is probably the most memorable. One acting teacher said that I "sucked at acting" in extreme frustration, which he then explained and modified a little bit, but it's especially memorable because I really felt it wasn't true, that I was good at acting, but it still hurt to receive the feedback. I think it was mainly that I cared about the acting teacher, but felt that I couldn't impress them, that made such a deep impact

4. I think constructive feedback can be non-constructive in some dimensions and vice versa. It's all about the intentions behind it, and those must be ascertained to really understand the feedback anyway. All feedback can be constructive if we can learn from it, and while this takes tremendous self-awareness I think it's ultimately the key to self-transcendence.
