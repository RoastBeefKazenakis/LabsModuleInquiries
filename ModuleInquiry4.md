2. I'm proud of this feature because it truly unlocks a good deal of the functionality of the app. It has a lot of  components as it involves doing dependency injections into several different views and making sure that the networking code was correct and in the correct place, so it had a pretty big scope. It was difficult getting to each portion of the process and keeping track of where I was, as well as making sure that the Storyboard had all of the necessary parameters, such as segues as identifiers. 

3. It allows the administrator to proceed to any of the hubs in the system and view and edit properties associated with that hub, which include pickups, team members, and production reports. It provides them with a dashboard that can navigate them to any of these options

4. I would have personally made changes to some of the names early on. Naming conventions, while they are mostly non-technical decisions, still have huge implications down the line in terms of readability of code and the understanding of the developers who need a mind-map of what's going on. If we had gotten some of the names right early on, we wouldn't have needed to change them later and just hope that we had caught all of the instances of our old name. Didn't create gigantic problems, but in a storyboard based environment like we were using in Swift with Xcode, it could have.
